<p>These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Waiview's Website, located at www.waiview.com and waiview.com.</p>

<p>By accessing this website we assume you accept these terms and conditions. Do not continue to use Waiview if you do not agree to take all of the terms and conditions stated on this page. Our Terms and Conditions were created with the help of the <a href="https://www.termsandconditionsgenerator.com">Terms And Conditions Generator</a> and the <a href="https://www.privacypolicyonline.com/terms-conditions-generator/">Free Terms & Conditions Generator</a>.</p>

<p>The following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy and Disclaimer Notice and all Agreements: "Client", "You" and "Your" refers to you, the person log on this website and compliant to these terms and conditions. "Ourselves", "We", "Our" and "Us", refers to the website and its creator. "Party", "Parties", or "Us", refers to both the Client and ourselves. All terms refer to the offer, acceptance and consideration of payment necessary to undertake the process of our assistance to the Client in the most appropriate manner for the express purpose of meeting the Client’s needs in respect of the provision of the Waiview's stated services. Any use of the above terminology or other words in the singular, plural, capitalization and/or he/she or they, are taken as interchangeable and therefore as referring to same.</p>

<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>

<p>We employ the use of cookies. By accessing Waiview, you agreed to use cookies in agreement with the Waiview's Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Most interactive websites use cookies to let us retrieve the user’s details for each visit. Cookies are used by our website to enable the functionality of certain areas to make it easier for people visiting our website.</p>

<h3><strong>License</strong></h3>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, Waiview and/or its licensors own the intellectual property rights for all material on Waiview. All intellectual property rights are reserved. You may access this from Waiview for your own personal use subjected to restrictions set in these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>You must not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Republish material from Waiview</li>
    <li>Sell, rent or sub-license material from Waiview</li>
    <li>Reproduce, duplicate or copy material from Waiview</li>
    <li>Redistribute content from Waiview</li>
</ul>

<p>This Agreement shall begin on the date hereof.</p>

<p>Parts of this website offer an opportunity for users to create accounts, which then allows them to  post, and exchange opinions, media content, and information in certain areas of the website (in the form of Stories, Images/Videos, and Resources/Links, and each of their respective comments and replies) (currently, Images/Videos do not include gifs). When you delete an account, all the posts associated with that account will be deleted, including stories, images/videos, resources/links, comments, and replies. Waiview does not filter, edit, publish or review posts prior to their presence on the website, except it does sometimes compress photos and videos when necessary. Posts do not reflect the views and opinions of Waiview, its agents and/or affiliates. Posts reflect the views and opinions of the person who post their views and opinions. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Waiview shall not be liable for the posts or for any liability, damages or expenses caused and/or suffered as a result of any use of and/or posting of and/or appearance of the posts on this website. Media files, including photos and videos, may be compressed and stored in an external storage service (currently Amazon S3), and when a post containing a media file is updated or deleted, that change is also reflected in the files in the  storage service. For example, if a post's media file changes and is updated from one to another, then the old media file will be deleted from the storage service and the new one will be added. If a post is deleted, the media file associated with the post that is stored in external storage will also be deleted. When uploading, the name of your file will be used to store your file in the storage service. If a filename already exists with that name, characters will be appended to the name of your file and this new name will be stored, in order to distinguish files with the same name. Large videos may be unable to be uploaded and an error may occur in the process of uploading. The same is true for some types or formats of videos. Some video formats may also be unsupported and lack the ability to be played from the website, which could depend on the browser.</p>

<p>A post can be updated, without limit, or deleted by the account that created a post. If choosing to create or update a post of a Story, Image/Video, or Link/Resource, it needs to be created or if already created, updated, under a specific topic and category, and Waiview sets all the available topics and categories. These three types of posts will be listed in their respective section on the website for anyone who uses the website to see, divided by topics and under each topic, by category. If we remove a topic or category that was associated and linked to a post, that post will now have "None" listed under the Topic heading or Category heading (in the view of the entire post, and for stories, in the view of all stories, in the view of that profile listing all your stories) depending on which was deleted, respectively. If the topic or category associated with a post is deleted, the post will still be listed and show up in the appropriate section (for example, if a post now has topic set to "None" but Category set to "Experiences" after a topic had been deleted by Waiview, the post will still be listed under the tab "All" Topics and both if picking under "All" Categories and under the Category "Experience" after being under the "All" Topics).
</p>

<p>If a post of a Story, Image/Video, or Link/Resource, is deleted by an account, all the comments and replies to that post will also be deleted. If any comment is deleted, all the replies to that comment will also be deleted.</p>

<p>Waiview reserves the right to monitor all posts and profiles and to remove any post or information which can be considered inappropriate, offensive or causes breach of these Terms and Conditions (as well as any posts that are not functional). Following this, Waiview also reserves the right to delete an account that has posts or profile information that meet the criteria previously stated. Waiview also reserves the right to being able to remove any posts that have been duplicated or posted twice (example, two posts with the same image or same video from same account). It also reserves the right to take quotes or sections of text from any post and display it on any page of the website Waiview. Waiview also reserves the right to rotate any photo that has been uploaded (the purpose of this is to show the right orientation of a photo to everyone if the upload process incorrectly rotates an image or the image uploaded was in the wrong orientation) (anyone can also contact us and ask us to rotate an image)</p>
