<h1>Privacy Policy for Waiview</h1>

<p>Last Updated: July 6, 2020</p>

<p>At Waiview, accessible from www.waiview.com and waiview.com, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains the types of information that is collected and recorded by Waiview and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in Waiview. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>

<p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it (for profile, for location for which a resource applies to...), will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>
<p>If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.</p>
<p>If you register for an Account, you must provide a username and password and have the option to add an email address to your account. Each of these is required, but may be changed after creating the account. Afterwards, you have the ability to edit your profile, where you have the option to provide contact and other miscellaneous information, including but not limited to items such as a profile picture, your first name, last name, email address(es), (If Applicable) occupation/current level of education and school, and timezone and format/view of the list of all stories you want to use (this timezone and this format can be picked from a range of options that Waiview provides, and a default is automatically set for you as ET (Eastern Time)—which is also used if you do not have an account—but you can change it if you would like). A timezone, profile picture, and format for stories are automatically set, but none of the other contact/miscellaneous information is required and can always be altered. Your username, first name, last name, occupation/current level of education/school, and profile picture will be public for everyone to see with your profile, as described in the profile section. A profile picture is automatically provided for you if you do not set one, a default profile picture. If you decide to set one, you can always change it to a different one. You may also have the ability to remove a custom profile picture completely, at which point the default profile picture will again be automatically set. You may register for multiple Accounts. On your profile, you can see your posts in each section (each different type of posts)- Stories, Images/Videos, and Resources/Links.</p>
